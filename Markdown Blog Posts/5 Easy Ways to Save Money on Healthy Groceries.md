But that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice on healthful, nutritious foods. Here are some grocery store tips to help you keep your costs low and save money.</p>

<h2>1. Plan your meals.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first thing to do is plan your meals! Use what's already in your pantry for inspiration, or see what's on sale at the grocery store. Then, write out all the meals you plan to make for the next few days to a week, and make of list of the items you need. Every weekend I try to see what I can make with what I already have at home, and also plan meals based on my local grocery store's sales flyer.</p>

<h2>2. Eat more plants.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feature plant-based proteins and in-season fruits and vegetables in your meal plans. You'll notice meat is often one of the more expensive items on your grocery list, so keeping meat to a minimum can help. Plus, plant-based proteins like beans, peas and lentils are just as nutritious and much, much cheaper. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seasonal fruits and vegetables are also a good deal because when the supply goes up, costs go down. You can buy in bulk if you have the freezer space, and eat seasonal produce all year round. Also buying frozen fruits and veggies on sale is also a great way to save money, and they're just as healthy too. </p>

<p>Being an Ontario native, I eat apples exclusively in the fall, because that's when they're at their peak freshness (and tastiest IMO). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. Set a budget.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How much do you usually spend each time you go grocery shopping? Take that average and try to stick with it. You can also pre-calculate how much your groceries will cost you, and pay with cash to prevent over-spending. Another easy way to prevent over-spending is to simply eat something before you go! Going grocery shopping on an empty stomach is never a good idea. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4. Navigate like a pro.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did you know that items placed at the top and bottom of shelves are cheaper than those placed at eye-level? Another money saving tip is to buy no-name or store-brand items since they usually cost less and have similar quality to expensive name-brands. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Checking the unit-cost of an item can help you compare similar foods of different sizes. For example, a large container of yogurt may be lower in cost per ounce compared to a small container of yogurt. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>5. Waste less food.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you find yourself throwing out food at the end of each week because you bought too much and it's all spoiled? To minimize this, make sure you plan your meals with overlapping ingredients! For example, if you're buying a whole bundle of celery, plan to use it in several dishes and snacks throughout the week. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't be afraid of leftovers either. Most batched meals can stay safe in the refrigerator for 2-4 days after cooking. Just be sure to reheat well before eating!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How to extend shelf life of produce: </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Store fresh fruits and vegetables unwashed. Wash just before you eat them. </li><li>Use brown bananas in baked goods or slice and freeze them for smoothies.</li><li>Ripen fruits at room temperature, then store in the refrigerator. </li><li>Keep fruits and vegetables in separate compartments in your fridge. Fruits produce a gas that can spoil vegetables. </li></ul>

<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eating a nutritious, healthful diet does not have to be expensive. Healthy eating can make you feel great in the moment and prevent many nutrition-related chronic conditions in the future like diabetes, high blood pressure or cholesterol. Yes, it takes careful planning, though consider it an investment in time that pays off in the short and long term.</p>
