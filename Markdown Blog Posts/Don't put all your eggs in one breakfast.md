#Don't put all your eggs in one breakfast. 


<p>Eggs can’t seem to get a break. First they’re in, then they’re out, and then the news cycle viciously <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2728487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeats</a>. Instead of getting into a heated debate on whether eggs are good or bad, I’ll say that <strong>no single food should be isolated and demonized, and that</strong> <strong>a balance of all foods are what really matters in the end</strong>. Otherwise, how could you eat mindfully without guilt, if you’re constantly worried about the healthfulness of that food?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eggs can still be apart of a healthy diet. And having a <a href="https://tracyjanenutrition.com/canadas-food-guide-2019-whats-in-and-whats-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">range of food types</a> could help you meet your nutrient requirements. Since eggs are generally considered a classic breakfast staple, let’s look at ways to balance the first meal of the day. </span></p>

<p>I’m Filipino-Canadian and love traditional Filipino breakfasts. A grand morning feast would start with garlic fried rice or pandesal (a sweet bread roll) with eggs over easy, longanisa (a sweet chorizo sausage) or tuyo (salted dried fish), a side of sautéed eggplant or plantain, garnished with fresh cilantro, diced tomatoes &amp; shallots, and finished with a slice of orange...truth be told, this is reserved for occasions when I have ample time.<br></p>

<p>Few people have the time and luxury to make a feast first thing in the morning. Most days I eat a simplified version of this: plain rice or sliced brown bread with 1 or 2 eggs, a squirt of ketchup, a piece of fruit, and a hot black coffee. It’s something quick and easy with little clean-up afterwards. I like to switch it up every now and then, and use the following rule to guide my breakfasts.</p>

<h2><strong>The Take-Away</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All foods fit within a healthy diet. We can look to our cultural backgrounds for ideas, and aim for diversity to meet our nutrient needs. To make breakfasts balanced, start with 3 basic food types and add variation here and there for some excitement to start your days. </p>
