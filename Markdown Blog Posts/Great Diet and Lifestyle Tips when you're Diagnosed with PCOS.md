#3 Great Diet and Lifestyle Tips when you're Diagnosed with PCOS. 


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1 in 10 women have PCOS, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a hormonal disorder diagnosed in women from their teens to thirties. Some of the common signs include: irregular periods, ovarian cysts, thinning hair, fatigue, facial hair, acne, high body weight, and risks for infertility, heart disease and diabetes. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The good news is, you can control the symptoms and risks of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353443" target="_blank">PCOS</a> with diet, lifestyle, and medical management. Here are my top 3 tips to help you take action for your health if you have PCOS:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>1. Nourish your body</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Practice self-compassion when it comes to “dieting.” You do not need to go on a restrictive diet to lose weight in a get-slim-quick-scheme. On the other hand, you do need to have an overall healthy diet, since weight gain with PCOS increases risks for high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To nourish your body, consider both what you eat and how you eat. Eat meals and snacks at regular time intervals to help manage your hunger and fullness levels. To improve your mindfulness, eat in a pleasant environment without distraction (no screens or phones) to help you appreciate the taste and textures of your food, and prevent mindless overeating. </p>

<h2><strong>2. Choose “Low Glycemic Index” foods more often</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://guidelines.diabetes.ca/docs/patient-resources/glycemic-index-food-guide.pdf" target="_blank">glycemic index</a> (GI) of a food measures how quickly it raises your blood sugar. The higher the index number, the faster and higher it raises your blood sugar. Since women with PCOS may have insulin sensitivities, their doctors may recommend a low-carb diet. However, there are ways to still choose carbs such as low glycemic whole grains and fruits, without raising your blood sugars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's a short list of foods by their Glycemic Index (GI):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:columns {"className":"has-2-columns"} -->
<div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns"><!-- wp:column -->
<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Low GI Foods (&lt; 55)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Whole grain starches (e.g. brown rice, brown bread)</li><li>Banana (greenish)</li><li>Cantaloupe</li><li>Grapefruit</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></div>
<!-- /wp:column -->

<!-- wp:column -->
<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Med-High GI Foods (&gt; 55)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Refined starches (e.g. white rice, white bread)</li><li>Banana (overripe)</li><li>Grapes</li><li>Orange juice</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></div>
<!-- /wp:column --></div>
<!-- /wp:columns -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even so, <strong>high glycemic foods are not forbidden</strong>. Pair these with other foods high in protein or fat to minimize blood sugar effects. For example, eat grapes (high GI) with nuts or cheese.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. Move your body</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other words, start with gentle exercise or physical activity. Exercise helps lower blood sugar levels, which is important for women with PCOS. Go dancing, take a walk, attend a fitness or boxing class. This is your chance to let off some steam (with a punching bag)!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember to include both cardio and strength training in your exercise routines. But don’t punish yourself at the gym: slowly increase your intensity and activity levels. Make it enjoyable, and focus on the uplifting mood it gives you. This is what’ll make regular exercise a lasting habit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Take-away</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A balanced diet and lifestyle is not only beneficial, it is<em> fundamental </em>to managing PCOS, and ultimately helps you feel better, mentally and physically. For many women, it’s hard knowing exactly where and how to begin. Get the right support to help meet your individual goals &amp; needs with actionable steps. </p>
