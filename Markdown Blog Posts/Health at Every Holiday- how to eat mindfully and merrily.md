#Health at Every Holiday: how to eat mindfully and merrily. 

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://haescommunity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Health at Every Size (opens in a new tab)">Health at Every Size</a> (HAES) is an approach based on scientific evidence that emphasizes health-promoting behaviours for all people regardless of weight status i.e. fat, skinny or medium-build. Instead of dieting for the sole purpose of losing weight, HAES encourages improving one’s relationship with food and their body, prioritizing nutritious food choices and partaking in enjoyable physical activity in response to self-compassion vs. self-punishment. </p>

<p>During the holidays, it may seem difficult to continue practicing healthful eating because of the many gatherings and celebrations surrounding food and “food temptations”. Here are my top 5 recommendations to help you let go of food fears during the holidays and stay healthy!</p>

<h4>1. Aim for balance </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This refers to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="balanced plate  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tracyjanenutrition.com/canadas-food-guide-2019-whats-in-and-whats-out/" target="_blank">balanced plate </a>which includes healthy proportions of all food groups and types i.e. half your plate of fruit and vegetables, a quarter of whole grains, and a quarter protein sources. For example, a classic holiday meal can be green bean casserole or roasted vegetables with scalloped potatoes and ham or turkey. </p>

<h4>2. Eat without guilt</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you tell yourself that you shouldn’t have a particular food, it can lead to intense feelings of deprivation that build into uncontrollable cravings and consequent bingeing. When you finally “give in” to your forbidden foods, it might result in overeating and overwhelming guilt. Therefore, if you give yourself unconditional permission to eat, you remove the feelings of deprivation and can enjoy your favourite holiday foods in an amount that makes you feel good. </p>

<h4>3. Stay active and hydrated</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now is the perfect time of year to participate in winter activities with family and friends. Go ice skating, skiing or sledding. You can also build more physical activity into your routine like walking around the mall or markets, and remember to carry a reusable water bottle with you to stay hydrated! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>4. Keep a journal</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Writing in a food journal can help you become more aware of your eating habits during the holidays. Include things like where you are, what you’re doing, how you’re feeling before and after eating. This way, you’ll be more mindful and in-tune with your body’s needs. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>5. Honour your hunger and fullness</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our eating is often guided by both internal and external factors. When we eat based on our body’s hunger and stop when full, we are eating by internal cues. Whereas when we eat based on the food environment and stop when the plate is clean, we are eating by external cues. Learn to trust your body and ask yourself mid-meals if you are still hungry or comfortably full. </p>

<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For many, the holidays are marked by increased eating opportunities (of food often higher in sugar and fat) leading to fears of weight gain, self-imposed restriction and unintentional overeating. Taking steps to eat well, without guilt and with mindfulness can help you feel more at ease around food at celebrations and truly enjoy the eating experience.&nbsp;<br></p>
