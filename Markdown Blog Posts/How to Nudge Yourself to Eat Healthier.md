#How to Nudge Yourself to Eat Healthier. 


<span style="font-weight: 400;">The typical weight gain for an adult is about 1 lb a year, and this added gain is linked to significant health risks later in life. Although there are no simple solutions for weight management, there are ways to nudge yourself into eating healthier.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Several diets, meal plans, and nutrition books exist, though sorting through the research can be daunting. You also need to consider that ‘how’</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">you eat is just as important as ‘what’</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">you eat, so I’ve put together some general tips to help maintain your weight or shed away some pounds (whichever your goal may be).</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>1. Tidy up your kitchen and have nutrient-rich foods readily available</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can accomplish this by <a href="https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780062136527/slim-by-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clearing your kitchen counter-tops</a> of all foods except for fruit. It helps if there are at least two types of fruit in the bowl. By keeping other snack foods hidden makes them less tempting, otherwise known as *out-of-sight, out-of-mind.* Also, stock your&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fridge and pantry with filling foods at eye-level. This way you're more likely to curb your hunger with quick and easy-to-prepare meals using basic ingredients: yogurt, eggs, milk, cheese, vegetables, fruit, whole grains, lean meats, nuts, canned beans, and canned fish.&nbsp;</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>2. When dining out, ask yourself "is the&nbsp;plate&nbsp;half-empty or half-full?"</strong></h3>
It feels tempting to finish all the food on your plate even when you're full, but restaurants often serve larger portions than you would normally serve yourself. Consider taking home leftovers or <em>ordering half-portion</em> entrees to prevent overeating. Similarly, if you're at a buffet<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, take a look at all your options first before selecting your food choices. Once you’re ready, fill<em> half your plate</em> with fruit, vegetables or salad, and the other half with whatever else you’d like. Do this each time you go back for more, which may help you rethink your second or third helpings. The <a href="http://www.halfyourplate.ca/what-is-half-your-plate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half-your-plate</a> advice does not only apply at buffets, but for most meals in and outside your home too.&nbsp;</span></span>

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>3. Learn some tricks to become a smarter grocery shopper</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are clever ways to nudge yourself into buying (and therefore eating) healthier options at the grocery store. You can designate the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/how-some-grocery-store-mirrors-nudge-you-toward-healthier-choices-1.4784081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">front half of your shopping cart</a> for fruits and vegetables to serve as a reminder. You can also l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inger in the produce isles a little longer by weaving through the stands. Take your time to enjoy the sight, smells and textures of nature’s beauty to help spark ideas for tasty recipes.&nbsp;</span>

&nbsp;

Following just a few of these suggestions may help manage your weight. You'll notice small changes in your home and in your habits can lead to healthier eating.
