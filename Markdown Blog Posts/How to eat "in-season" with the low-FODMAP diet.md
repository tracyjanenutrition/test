#How to eat "in-season" with the low-FODMAP diet. 


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Summer is coming. And in Southern Ontario, that means it’s prime time to get fresh produce. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2014/06/farmers_markets_in_toronto_by_day_of_the_week/" target="_blank">Farmers’ markets</a> are popping-up offering the season’s peak harvest, but for people following the low-FODMAP<sup>1</sup> diet for digestive health reasons, choosing the right fruits and vegetables are not an easy task. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The low-FODMAP diet is a short-term diet used to help people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</strong>. Foods with certain sugars and fibres are systematically removed and added-back in phases: the goal is to learn which foods are causing chronic symptoms like painful bloating, gas, constipation and diarrhea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rules about food restrictions, portion sizes, timing and complications can be overwhelming. Nonetheless, maintaining a nutritious diet with all the food groups is vital for overall health. For this reason, shopping at a farmer’s market for seasonal ingredients can be a joyous event instead of a burden. <strong>Take this list with you when shopping this summer for Ontario’s seasonal low-FODMAP fruits &amp; veggies.</strong><sup>2</sup></p>

<h2>The Take-away</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the low-FODMAP diet is restrictive, there is still room to expand your plate. Use inspiration from the fresh and colourful allure of in-season fruits and vegetables to boost and benefit your nutritional intake! Plus, supporting farmers markets is good for the environment and local economy too.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> the low-FODMAP diet is best supervised by a dietitian to ensure you’re doing it safely, while meeting your nutrient needs, managing symptoms, and to help simplify food choices. </p>
