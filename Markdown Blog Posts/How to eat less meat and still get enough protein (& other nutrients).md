#How to eat less meat and still get enough protein (& other nutrients)

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a meat-heavy diet and want to transition to eating less meat, this article is for you. More and more people are choosing vegetarian or vegan options for health, ethical or environmental reasons. So, let’s explore the meatless-alternatives and what nutrients they have to offer!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is protein and what are good meatless-alternatives?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Protein is important for the growth, repair, and function of muscles, nerves, hormones, and the immune system. Yes, meat, fish and poultry are great sources of protein. But so are eggs, dairy, soy, nuts, beans, lentils and whole grains.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>When you eat less meat, what nutrients do you need to consider?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Animal-based sources of protein are high in nutrients like <strong>iron, vitamin D, and B12 </strong>to name a few. Likewise, it's important to choose alternatives that also have these vitamins and minerals. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Iron </strong>helps carry oxygen around your body, giving you energy. To best absorb iron from plant-based sources (such as beans, lentils, leafy green vegetables and whole grains) eat these with food containing vitamin C (like citrus fruits, strawberries, tomatoes, bell peppers, etc.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Vitamin D</strong> helps absorb calcium to build strong bones. Eggs and fortified beverages contain vitamin D, and you can also get it from the sun!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Vitamin B12 </strong>helps make new blood cells and plays a role in energy levels. Lacto-ovo vegetarian sources include dairy and eggs. Vegan sources include nutritional yeast and fortified milks and cereals.</p>

<h2>How much protein do you need to eat?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A healthy person with a moderately-active lifestyle needs about 1 gram of protein for every kilogram of body weight:<a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthy-eating/quick-nutrition-check-protein" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"> 1 g protein/1 kg body weight</a> per day. For example, if you weigh 60 kg (132 lbs), you would need about 60 g of protein everyday to maintain your health and weight. To meet this, you can aim for 15-20 g of protein per meal and 5-10 g protein per snack. Use the chart above to estimate if you’re meeting your needs!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to make sure you’re eating enough protein is to include a protein-source of food at most meals.</p>

<h2>The Takeaway + Pro Tip</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meeting your protein, vitamin and mineral needs is possible when eating less meat. One tip for getting started is to pick a day and make it meatless. The challenge begins when there are other competing dietary restrictions, allergies, intolerances or preferences to consider, and this is where a Registered Dietitian can help.</p>
