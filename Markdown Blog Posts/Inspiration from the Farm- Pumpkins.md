<p>In my practice, I often recommend my clients to “Eat the Rainbow” and it’s because naturally colourful foods are high in vitamins and minerals.The rich orange hues of pumpkins indicate it’s an amazing source of vitamin A. It’s also very high in B vitamins like thiamine and riboflavin, as well as vitamin C. Pumpkin seeds are a great source of protein and iron too. All together, these nutrients contribute to healthy skin, sight, muscles and overall health.&nbsp;</p>
