#Inspiration from the Fridge: Fermented Foods. 

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welcome back to the second installment of my “Inspiration from the Fridge” series featuring fermented foods! In this post, we’ll look at the history, nutritional value, and ways to incorporate fermented foods into your lifestyle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In many cultures, certain <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="foods are fermented (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/fermented-foods" target="_blank">foods are fermented</a> to extend shelf life and generate exciting new flavours. By definition, fermentation in food processing is the breakdown of sugars into alcohols and acids by live microorganisms in the absence of air. Vegetables, fruits, dairy, soy, grains and even tea can be fermented. Some examples include sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, cheese, kefir, tempeh, wine, beer, kombucha and so much more! </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fermentation process also adds to the nutritional value since it uses live cultures of bacteria known as <strong>probiotics</strong>, meaning <strong>“beneficial bacteria”</strong> and it is widely recognized that fermented foods and probiotics have a potential in maintaining health and preventing disease.</p>

<h2>The Versatility of Kimchi, Kefir and Kombucha </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fermented foods are a part of a healthy, balanced diet. I personally try to integrate a variety of them into my day-to-day. If you keep any of the following foods, there are plenty of ways to use them:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kimchi</strong> is a tangy Korean cabbage condiment and is found pretty much ubiquitously in Asian grocers. Once opened, it lasts in the fridge for about 3 months. And like ketchup, I add it to almost everything! The bold taste and crunchy texture of kimchi compliments well with many dishes. A little goes a long way: the intense aroma adds a kick to an otherwise bland meal. Whether I’m having plain rice and fish, or noodles and tofu, kimchi is sure to make an appearance. Sometimes I’ll even have kimchi as a snack, mixed with cottage cheese or sliced apples. The saltiness, creaminess, and sweetness balance each other in a surprising, yet delightful way.</p>

<p><strong>Kefir </strong>is a fermented milk beverage and originates from Russia. It’s now consumed around the globe, and you can find it in most grocery stores or even online. It’s usually consumed like a drinkable yogurt, though there are other ways to enjoy kefir other than gulping a full glass of it. Right now I’m trying a coconut kind by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="KefirKultures (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.kefirkultures.com/" target="_blank">KefirKultures</a>. This one is unique in that it’s concentrated and dairy-free. I like to add a few tablespoons to fruit salads, smoothies or chia seed puddings. The versatility of this coconut kefir milk inspires me to experiment with kefir in creative ways and I’ll be sure to add more ideas to my future recipes section.</p>

<p><strong>Kombucha</strong> is a fermented tea beverage and is frequently cited as originating in North East Asia in 220 B.C. It’s slightly sweet, slightly sour, bubbly, and is a healthier alternative to sugary sodas (some brands have as little as 5 g of sugar per serving compared to 35 g in sodas). The popularity of probiotics has catapulted kombucha into the mainstream making it a common beverage in numerous grocery and health food stores. It can be home-brewed too, and when I was given a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="SCOBY (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCOBY" target="_blank">SCOBY</a> (a kombucha starter) during my dietetic internship as a thank-you gift from my mentor, I was so excited by the myriad of fruit and herbal tea blends I could make with it! </p>

<p>Including a few fermented foods in your daily meals is a great way to benefit from probiotics. Overall, appreciating the many ways fermented foods could add complex flavour and nourishment to your everyday diet. Bon-appetit!</p>

<h3>Note</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep in mind that probiotics are not a “cure” and <a href="https://tracyjanenutrition.com/services-and-fees/">specific conditions</a> may be nutritionally managed with the help of a dietitian.</p>
