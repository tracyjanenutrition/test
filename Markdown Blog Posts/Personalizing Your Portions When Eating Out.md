#Personalizing Your Portions When Eating Out. 


<p>Whether you eat out occasionally, weekly, or daily, you’ve probably noticed the meals served in restaurants are larger than you would typically serve yourself. Hefty portions make you feel like you’re getting your money’s worth. But the pattern of overeating on a regular basis can be harmful to your waistline and your wallet. All the more reason for you to not finish your plate and take the rest of it to-go!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Step 1. <strong>Listen to your body’s hunger cues</strong>.</h3>
<p>Are you eating quickly, slowly? Are you savouring every bite? Take your time and drink plenty of water while you eat. You’ll notice your feeling of fullness approach even before you finish your meal.

<h3>Step 2. <strong>Ask for a to-go container even if you’re dining in</strong>.</h3>
<p>Pack-up the remainders and take it home or to the office (some workplaces have fridges for employees). Be careful, some to-go boxes may leak, so wrap in extra layers to avoid spills.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Step 3. <strong>Whenever you’re ready for your next meal, simply heat and eat. </strong></h3>
<p>Leftovers can make a nice afternoon snack or can be incorporated into a balanced meal. Play chef with what you’ve got. Here are some ideas on how use those leftovers as ingredients or complements to other dishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leftover <strong>meat</strong> can be cut up into strips, stir fried with veggies (or frozen peas – a staple in almost every freezer), and served with a side of rice or potatoes</li>
<li>Mix leftover <strong>fish</strong> with curried rice, onions, herbs, boiled eggs and butter (aka. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedgeree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kedgeree</a>)</li>
<li>Pasta, pizza or other <strong>carbs</strong> can be served with a side of fresh greens, sliced radish, and a sprinkle of seeds or grated cheese, drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar</li>
</ul>
