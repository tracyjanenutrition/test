#The 3 Most Important Things to Look for on a Nutrition Label. 


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you've ever eaten something from a box, you've likely seen a Nutrition label before. It's that panel on the side of most packaged and processed foods with all these numbers and nutrients on it, but what does it all mean? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nutrition Facts label explains what nutrients and how much of those nutrients are in a single serving of food. Like I said, it's on most foods you'll find in the grocery store isles, but not on fresh foods like fruits, vegetables, fish and meats. Overall, the label can help you compare similar foods to make healthier choices. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every label includes information on calories and 13 nutrients: fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrate, fibre, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium and iron, and % Daily Values. These nutrients are included not because they're all healthy, but because it's what's considered important by most consumers and health professionals. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With so much information on the label, how can you make use of it all? To read and really understand the Nutrition Facts label, look for these 3 things:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>1. <strong>The Serving Size</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The serving size listed in Nutrition Facts is the amount that is often consumed at one sitting. Compare this to the amount you actually eat to see if you're eating more or less of what's on the label. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>2. The Percent Daily Value</strong> (%DV)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> The % Daily Value is a tool used to quickly see whether there is “a lot” or “a little” of a nutrient in a serving of food. This essentially tells you the percentage of a nutrient that is in one serving compared to the recommended intake each day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Less than 5% is considered "a little"</strong></li><li><strong>More than 15% is considered "a lot"</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example,  if the label lists 15% for calcium, this means one serving provides 15% of the calcium that is recommended in a day, which is "a lot."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>3. The Best Profile</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Compare similar products and choose the option that has the healthiest profile. To do this, look for specific nutrients of concern that you want either more or less of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table -->
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>LESS</strong> (a little)</td><td><strong>MORE</strong>   (a lot)</td></tr><tr><td>Saturated Fats<br>Trans Fats<br>Sodium<br>Sugar</td><td>Fibre<br>Vitamin A<br>Calcium<br>Iron<br>Protein</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tips for choosing the best profile:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>foods that have less than 15% Daily Value of Sodium</em></li><li><em>products with no trans-fat</em></li><li><em>breads with at least 2g fibre per slice</em></li><li><em>breakfast cereals with at least 4g fibre per serving</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, try to limit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">added sugars</span>. A low amount of sugar in a packaged food item would be under 10 grams, where 1 teaspoon sugar = 4 grams. <strong>Please note this does not include sugars found naturally in dairy, fruit and vegetables</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nutrition labels can help guide your usual food choices. You don't have read the label for every food or beverage you consume, but learning about the food you eat can help you make healthier options more often.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a nutrition-related health condition, or specific dietary restrictions or intolerances, seeking the support of a Registered Dietitian can help you better navigate nutrition labels and food choices. <br></p>
