<h2>Exercise helps regulate insulin and blood sugar levels.</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Women with PCOS have an increased risk for diabetes. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use sugar for energy, and PCOS impairs the body’s ability to use insulin properly, leading to higher insulin and blood sugar levels. You can naturally lower these levels with exercise. Physical activity directly helps improve the body’s response to insulin which stabilizes blood sugars, therefore decreasing the risk for diabetes.</p>

<h2><strong>How much and how often to do physical activity? Doing some is better than none.</strong></h2>

<p>Being more physically active involves both moving more and being less sedentary. Since sitting is commonly considered the new smoking, here are some tips to sit less throughout the day:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Set a reminder on your phone to move around every 45-60 minutes of prolonged sitting</li><li>At work, instead of sit-down meetings, suggest walk-and-talk meetings for small groups of 1-2 people</li><li>At home, stand up during TV commercials, while reading articles, or when playing games on your smartphone</li></ul>

<p>To be more physically active, it also helps to know the benefits. Exercise and body movement not only reduces numerous health risks, it improves mood, appetite regulation, quality of sleep, strength, and stamina. To see these benefits, aim for 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. You can break it up into several chunks throughout the day or week, and be sure to include a couple muscle-strengthening activities as well!</p>
