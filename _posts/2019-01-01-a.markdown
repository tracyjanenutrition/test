#10 Healthful Tips for Rotational Shiftwork & Extended Work Days

<p>Three out of ten Canadians work outside of the usual 8am to 6pm time period; working instead rotating nights, afternoons, mornings or extended work day schedules. <a href="https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/shiftwrk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Shiftwork (opens in a new tab)">Shiftwork</a> or <a href="https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/workday.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="extended hours (opens in a new tab)">extended hours</a> are common in healthcare, hospitality, retail, manufacturing, protective and transportation services.</p>
<p>Some people like shift work because it allows for more free time; however, many people find that it disrupts their family and personal life and leads to health problems including chronic fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders. Working shifts can also upset your body’s “internal clock” which tells your body to be awake during the day and to sleep at night.</p>
<p>Day-to-day difficulties may include deciding when to eat, exercise and sleep, resulting in changes in appetite, weight, energy levels, constipation, diarrhea, and so on. The good news is that by eating well and keeping active you can avoid some of these problems. Follow these nutrition and lifestyle tips to stay healthy, alert and feel your best at work and at home.</p>
<h2>1. <strong>Eat your “main meal” before going to work</strong>.</h2>
<p>If you are on the afternoon shift have your main meal at mid-day around noon. If you are on the evening shift, eat your main meal at about 6 pm before you go to work. Have a small meal and healthy snacks throughout your shift since eating large meals during the night can cause heartburn, gas, or constipation. It can also make you feel sleepy and sluggish. Aim for <a href="https://tracyjanenutrition.com/canadas-food-guide-2019-whats-in-and-whats-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">balanced meals</a> with whole grains, healthy fats, protein sources, fruits and vegetables.</p>
<h2>2. <strong>Pack your own healthy snacks</strong>.</h2>
<p>It can be difficult to find healthy snacks during the afternoon and night shifts as the cafeteria may be closed, and vending machines may only carry salty or high fat snacks, and sugary drinks. Examples of good snacks are:</p>
<ul><li>Fresh fruit with nuts and plain yogurt</li><li>Crackers or fruit and cheese</li><li>Tea cookies and milk</li><li>A small fruit and nut muffin</li><li>Banana with peanut butter</li><li>Baby carrots with hummus</li></ul>
<h2>3. <strong>Limit overly processed foods: deep fried foods, sugary foods and drinks. </strong></h2>
<p>Large portions of french fries or fried chicken can lead to heartburn or indigestion. Sugary foods and drinks like chocolate bars or soft drinks may give you a quick boost of energy temporarily, but result in feelings of low energy later on. Overall, eating high fat or sugary foods too often can increase your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<h2>4. <strong>Be mindful of your eating habits.</strong></h2>
<p>Healthful eating is more than what you eat, it’s also about how and why you eat. Whether at work or home, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="take your time eating (opens in a new tab)" href="https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/healthy-eating-recommendations/be-mindful-of-your-eating-habits/take-time-to-eat/" target="_blank">take your time eating</a> and don’t rush. Eating without distractions can help you notice your fullness as well. Use your breaks to enjoy your meals and snacks, and if possible, eat with your co-workers for some company. </p>
<h2>5. <strong>Stay well hydrated.</strong></h2>
<p>Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration. It may help you to stay alert and not feel so tired during your shift. Keep a water bottle nearby and take sips even before you feel thirsty. Milk, tea, and unsweetened plant-based alternatives, are other nutritious beverages that you can drink. </p>
<h2>6. <strong>Watch the caffeine.</strong></h2>
<p>Drinking coffee, tea and other caffeinated beverages can help you stay alert. But don’t consume more than 400 mg of caffeine a day, which is about the amount of caffeine found in two to three small cups of regular coffee. Caffeine can stay in your system for up to eight hours, which can affect your sleep. Switch to decaffeinated drinks, unsweetened herbal tea or water about six-to-eight hours before bedtime.</p>

<h2>10. <strong>Honour your health.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you value your body, you prioritize your health, diet and exercise. Respect your body and health by participating in physical activities that you enjoy. You can also be more active by sitting less; take the stairs, stand and stretch every hour or break. And remember that you don't have to eat a perfect diet to be healthy. You will not suddenly get a nutrient deficiency or gain weight from one snack, one meal, or one day of eating. </p>
