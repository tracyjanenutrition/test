#Can CBD treat IBS?  


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many people with IBS are in search of a solution for their symptoms. In the hopes of finding the right treatment, CBD shows promise when nothing else seems to work. </p>

<h2>What is IBS?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360016" target="_blank">IBS</a>) is a condition that affects 15% of the world’s population. It is characterized by difficult-to-manage symptoms like painful bloating, cramping, excessive gas, diarrhea, and constipation. Although the exact causes of IBS varies from person to person, possible factors include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Brain-gut axis (poorly coordinated signals between the brain and intestines)</li><li>Severe infection caused by a bacteria or virus, resulting changes in the microbiome (bacterial overgrowth)</li><li>Food intolerances (reaction to specific nutrients e.g. sugar alcohols, lactose, fibre, fructans, gluten etc.)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Presently there is no cure for IBS, but the goal is to reduce inflammation and control symptoms. The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20360064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">current therapies</a> are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Medical: laxatives, antidiarrheal, antidepressants, antibiotics, pain medications, IBS specific meds</li><li>Nutritional/lifestyle: regular and healthy eating habits, sleep, fibre supplements, probiotics, psychotherapy, stress management, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tracyjanenutrition.com/how-to-eat-in-season-with-the-low-fodmap-diet/" target="_blank">low-FODMAP diet</a></li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the above prove not to be effective, CBD may be helpful. Let's consider the rationale and evidence. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Endocannabinoid System </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The endocannabinoids system (ESC) is a complex cell-signalling system. Our bodies make molecules called endocannabinoids, which play a role in regulating a wide variety of functions including sleep, mood, appetite, digestion, stress, pain and much more.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cannabis is a drug from a plant, which contains molecules similar to our endocannabinoids called cannabinoids, most notably tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis works by upregulating or down-regulating certain functions in our endocannabinoid system, and it has been used throughout history for its therapeutic benefits. Research shows THC and CBD to have the following potential effects: </p>

<h2>Putting it together: The recommendations of CBD in managing IBS</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing how CBD plays a role in reducing pain, inflammation and anxiety, there’s a possibility it could be helpful for some people with IBS; however, evidence is limited and therefore no firm conclusions can be made for its safety and efficacy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What you should also know is that CBD does not alter the course of the disease, meaning it’s not a cure, only a coping strategy to control the symptoms and quality of life. I consider it a “complementary” approach, in addition to the current medical and nutrition treatment plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is the right dose?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CBD is not a one-size fits all therapy. An effective therapeutic dose is often informed by trial and error. Please speak with a physician with proficient medical-cannabis patient-care for individualized prescriptions and customized treatment plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Caution! Cannabis is not recommended in the following:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>History of substance abuse&nbsp;</li><li>Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome</li><li>History of mental health issues</li><li>Family history of psychosis</li><li>Liver disease/cardiac disease</li><li>Pregnancy/planning to get pregnant</li></ul>
