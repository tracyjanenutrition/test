#Do you need a vitamin and mineral supplement?  


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chances are you don’t need a supplement, though there are of course exceptions and I’ve listed below cases where one may be necessary. If you’re eating a balanced diet with a variety of food groups, you’re likely meeting your vitamin and mineral requirements. Plus, the Canadian food supply is filled with enriched and fortified foods lining the grocery aisles, which makes additional supplementation even less compelling. And hey, vitamins in foods don’t cost anything, so why not save a few dollars?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vitamin D and B12 supplements are highly marketed by both industry and health care professionals. Low blood levels of these vitamins may warrant a recommendation for a supplement; however, they can also be obtained from your diet to help maintain healthy levels.</p>

<h2><strong>Tips for getting more Vitamin D and B12 from food:</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These vitamins often occur naturally and fortified in the same sources of food: cow’s milk, fatty fish and shellfish, meat, poultry, margarine, egg yolks, fortified soy and rice beverages, fortified orange juice and fortified yogurts. To see if a product contains vitamin D and B12, check the nutrition label!</p>

<ul><li>Have fortified yogurt with fruit and nuts for breakfast or a snack</li><li>Have an unsweetened café latte or tea latte instead of black coffee/tea</li><li>Try a whole grain bagel with cottage cheese, topped with ripe, sliced pears</li><li>Make a smoothie with a fortified soy-beverage and your favourite fruit: unsweetened vanilla or chocolate soy-beverage with strawberries and bananas</li><li>Try canned salmon in your wrap or sandwich</li><li>Add sardines to pizza</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Improving dietary choices should be the priority when seeking the benefits of vitamins and minerals, as potentials for harm and toxicity do exist with supplementation. I advise you to speak with your health care provider or Registered Dietitian before taking any supplements.</p>
