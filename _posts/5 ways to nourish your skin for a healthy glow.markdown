#5 ways to nourish your skin for a healthy glow. 


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you want clear and even skin? It may not be easy but it is possible to protect, heal and nourish your skin to look its best. Read on for my most important food and lifestyle tips to get you glowing from the inside, out!</p>

<h2>1. <strong>Eat a diverse and balanced diet to get all the nutrients your skin needs</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While there are no specific foods or food groups recommended for clear and healthy skin, there are certain vitamins and minerals that play a role in skin health. These include vitamin A, vitamin C, B vitamins, vitamin E, zinc and selenium. More is not always better, however. Getting your nutrients from a balanced and varied diet is the surest way to benefit your overall health including your skin. These are found in a range of foods such as orange and dark green fruits and vegetables, meat, seafood, dairy, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Limit the sugar and salt</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m talking about refined sugar added to processed foods. Not the natural kind found in fruits, vegetables, and milk -- those are fine. For added sugars, aim for less than 25 g per day which is under 6 teaspoons. Check nutrition labels the next time you grab something to eat or drink. It might surprise you. To lower sugar intake, try swapping soda with sparkling water, choose plain yogurt instead of flavoured yogurt, or pick breakfast cereals with less than 6 g of sugar per serving.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Salt is another culprit! About 1 teaspoon is the recommended daily limit, and many North Americans exceed this. Mainly because salt is used as a preservative in a lot of foods, so it’s difficult to avoid. Top sources include bread, baked goods, fast-, frozen- and ready-made foods. To cut down on salt, be more mindful of how much processed vs. homemade food you’re eating.</p>

<p>Lowering both added sugar and salt is a way to improve overall diet quality. It helps you choose more wholesome instead of packaged foods to meet your ultimate goal of better health and therefore better skin.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>3. Be active and stay hydrated</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exercise is great for your skin. Any and all activities from running to weightlifting, improves blood flow to the skin’s surface, giving you that rosy glow. And don’t forget to drink plenty of water too. When your pee is an almost clear pale yellow, that is a sign of good hydration. Drinking enough water helps your body get rid of toxins, giving you a refreshed appearance. </p>

<h2><strong>4. Wear sun protection</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Really, the only product necessary for beautiful and radiant skin is a basic SPF sunscreen. I use an oil-free moisturizing SPF lotion for my dry and pimple-prone skin. Apply a nickel sized dollop to your face whenever you go out in daylight. The SPF should be at least 15 for adequate protection, and ideally 30 or higher for longer periods spent outdoors.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Finally, get some rest &amp; relaxation</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Improving your diet, increasing your exercise, and wearing sun protection isn’t always enough if you’re stressed out and not sleeping enough. To reduce dark circles and puffy eyes, make time for rest and relaxation. Make it a priority. Try a few things out to see if they help. Is it yoga? Burning incense sticks while listening to spa-like music? Putting down your phone 1 hour before bed? Create a wind-down routine for yourself to help you drift into a good night’s sleep. Your skin will thank you for it.</p>

<h2><strong>&nbsp;The takeaway</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are no quick fixes in life and that includes healthy skin. Long-term commitments to eating well and self-care will reward you. And it’s not in vain to want a clear complexion. Often, healthy skin is a sign of a healthy body. One step at a time is all it takes. What will your first step be?</p>
