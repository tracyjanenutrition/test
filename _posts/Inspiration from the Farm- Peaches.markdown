#Inspiration from the Farm: Peaches

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No summer is complete without a trip to the farmers' markets. They're open  throughout different days of the week, and it's a great opportunity for you to check out some local vendors and stock up on fresh produce. Today's produce spotlight: peaches!</p>

<h2>The Health Benefits</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Peaches are a good source of vitamin C, which supports your immune system and is important for maintaining skin integrity. As an antioxidant, vitamin C helps to lower the risks of cancer. Peaches have a low glycemic index and contain dietary fibre which means your blood sugar level will remain steady and you will feel full longer. </p>

<h2>How to Pick the Perfect Peach</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmers markets are your best bet for ripe peaches since they're local and don't have to travel far. Smell is a good indicator of flavour; choose ones that are fragrant and smell sweet. Look for peaches that are neither green nor overly soft; ones with fuzzy skin and give in slightly when pressed. Firm peaches can be stored in room temperature and out of direct sunlight until they become soft enough for consumption. Keeping them in paper bags may speed up the ripening process. Once they become ripe, you may keep them in the fridge for up to about five days.</p>

<h2>Creative Ways to Use Peaches</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A peach on its own is a sweet, nutritious and hydrating snack! They can also be sliced and used to top yogurts, oatmeal, pancakes or waffles as a breakfast idea. For a quick and easy lunch or dinner, you can add sliced peaches to a bed of greens, topped with sources of protein (nuts, chicken, salmon, etc.). With ripe peaches, you can freeze, preserve or make them into jams and jellies, or bake them into cobblers and pies!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Visiting the farmers' market is a great way to support local family farmers. It's the place to go for the most fresh produce and to meet the people who grow your food. You can also show support by buying local produce in grocery stores.
