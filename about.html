    <p>
    Hello again. A little about me, I’m a Registered Dietitian in private practice and I specialize in nutrition management strategies for digestive health, women’s reproductive health, and sustainable lifestyle habits for wellness.
    </p>
    <p>
    To become a Registered Dietitian, I received a Master of Applied Sciences degree in Human Nutrition from McGill University, and completed an intensive dietetic internship. I am regulated by the College of Dietitians of Ontario, a licensing body that requires me to adhere to standards of practice and stay relevant on the latest research and information in nutrition and health.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I first began my practice, I noticed many of my clients sought support for similar concerns, and so I took this opportunity to focus on evidence-based nutrition therapies for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), and Health at Every Size (HAES).
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure my clients improve their physical and mental health through food and nutrition, I continue to pursue knowledge and understanding of up-to-date nutritional and behavioural therapies. As a result, I incorporate mindful and intuitive eating principles to help my clients find balance and better their relationship with food, mind and body.
      </p>
