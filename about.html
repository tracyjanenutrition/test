    <h1 class="big-heading">How I can help</h1>
    <p>
      I started my private practice in downtown Toronto in the fall of 2018,
      shortly after completing my dietetic internship with McGill University.
      After returning home from Montreal, I began my journey as a practicing
      Registered Dietitian by combining my entrepreneurial spirit with my
      license to counsel for nutritional management of chronic health
      conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      With my office space in the heart of city, I discovered a need from people
      seeking help predominantly for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Polycystic
      Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and weight loss, and so I gravitated towards
      specializing in nutrition therapies for digestive health, womenâ€™s health
      conditions and sustainable weight management.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure an optimal experience for my clients and to truly achieve better
      health through food and habits, I continue to pursue knowledge and
      understanding of emerging nutrition therapies and approaches to behaviour
      change. As a result, I incorporate mindful and intuitive eating principles
      in my sessions to help my clients find balance and ultimately improve
      their health and relationship with food, mind and body.
