  Hi, I’m Tracy Jane. I’m a Registered Dietitian and my practice focuses on helping people develop healthier relationships with food, and nutritionally managing chronic conditions.

If you feel stressed about eating right for your digestive health or endocrine disorder; nutrition counselling can make all the difference in providing clarity, direction and optimal health.

I help my clients feel better and take control of their health through food and nutrition, via in-person or online counselling. Together, we will create a personalized action plan with supporting resources to meet your goals. By the end of our sessions, you will feel more confident in managing your symptoms, developing healthier eating habits and overall improving your wellbeing.
